1. `git init` --> Powers your folder to be managed by git and initialises a new empty repository. It also created a .git folder that has all relevant logic to manage versions of your project.

2. `Working area` --> There can be a bunch of files that are not currently handled by git.
   It means that changes are done or to be done in those files are not managed by git yet.
   A file which is in working area is considered to be not in the staging area. When we do 'git status' and we see bunch of 'untracked files' then these are actually called to be in the working area.

3. `Staging area` --> What all files are going to be part of the next version that we will create. This staging area is the place where git knows what changes will be done from the last version to the next version.

4. `Respository area` --> This area actually contains the details of all your previous registered versions.
   And the files in this area, git already manages them and knows their version history.

5. `git add <file>` --> moves file from working area to staging area.

6. `git rm --cached <file>` --> moves file back from stagging area to working area.

7. `commit` --> Commit is a particular version of the project. It captures a snapshot of the project's staged changes and creates a version of it.

8. `git commit` --> registers staging changes to a commit.

9. `git log` --> lists down all the commits of the repository. If you want to wxit out of the git log prompt press 'q'.

10. `git restore <file>` --> it removes all the file changes from the stagging area to be committed. This can be useful, if we did some dirty piece of code and now no more want it. Instead of deleting every change line by line, we can restore it or you can say restore last clean version of the file.

11.Playing with staging and working area of a committed repository.

12. `git restore --stages <file>` --> It removes file changes from staging area to working area.
    This only works if changes are in your staging area.

13. Difference between git rm and git restore
    Ans: If you want to move the whole file back to the untracked state, then we do
    `git rm`, otherwise if we just want the changes to be moved in working area or staging area then `git restore`

14. `git diff commit1 commit2` --> gives the difference between two commits.

15. `git commit -m <your commit message>` --> If we want to avoid opening a text editor like vim/nano to add commit message we can use this following command.

16. `git remote` --> list down all the remote connection names

17. Remote connection --> It helps you to link two git repositories for uploading and downloading changes from each otherwise.

18. `git remote add <name of the remote> <link of the remote>` : This command helps us to add a new link to the remote repo and give a name to it.

19. `git remote rm <name of the remote>` --> this command deletes a remote connection.

20. `git remote rename <olname> <newname>` : this command renames the remote connection.

Note : The name of the remote connection is always used to establish communication between the repos.

21. `git add <file1> <file2> <file3>` : this command will add multiple file changes together in the staging area.

22. `git add .` --> this command will add all files from working repo to staging area.

23. `git pull <remote name> <branch name>` : downloads latest changes from the branch of the mentioned remote in your local repo.

# Recommended Practice to do :

- make changes
- git add <file>
- git commit -m "Commit"
- git pull
- git push

24. Megre conflicts are a very common scenario.
